    <summary lang="en">Automatically synchronize Kodi's video library and local NFO files</summary>
	<description lang="en">Keeps Kodi's video library and .nfo files closely synchronized, by enriching the way Kodi manages these nfo files.
This set of tools is intended for advanced Kodi users, with large libraries and / or multi-room configurations.
It helps maintaining a standardized / centralized / sustainable source of video metadata in multiple .nfo files, as well as keeping Kodi instances updated all along.

If you are not confident with scrapers and .nfo file processing in Kodi, this addon is probably not meant for you...

Main functionalities:
  - import: refresh Kodi entries when a nfo is updated
  - export: update the nfo when an entry is modified (watched status)
  - automate behaviour by catching the relevant Kodi events

Configuration:
  Set the **Local information only** scraper on all your movie media sources.
  Optionally, you may want to set the following settings in Kodi:
    - Update library on startup
    - importwatchedstate and importresumepoint

  For more information, please see the project site: https://github.com/bpakodi/service.nfo.sync

Limitations:
  - warning: still in alpha version, use at your own risk!
  - only movies are covered for the moment... please be patient :-)
