    <summary lang="en">Keep Kodi's video library and local NFO files synchronized automatically</summary>
	<description lang="en">Extend the way Kodi manages NFO files, with an automatic synchronization of your video library and NFOs altogether.

Also summon some magic and apply tags dynamically to your video entries, thanks to user-defined scripts!

Main functionalities:
  - service: automated processes running in background, triggered by Kodi events
  - import: refresh Kodi entries automatically, when a NFO is updated
  - export: update the NFO automatically, when an entry is modified (watched status only for the moment)
  - custom scripts: fully customize the content of your NFOs, using a simple Python syntax

Configuration:
  1. Set the **Local information only** scraper on all your movie media sources
  2. Check the nfo sync configuration
  3. Launch a first library scan and start playing...

Please check the project site for source code and wiki:
** https://github.com/bpakodi/service.nfo.sync **

Disclaimer:
  This set of tools is intended for advanced Kodi users, with large libraries and / or multi-room configurations. If you are not confident with scrapers and .nfo file processing in Kodi, this addon is probably not meant for you...
  And it's still alpha version, you know, so use at your own risk!

Known limitations:
  - only movies are managed for the moment... please be patient :-)
  - Kodi v18 (Leia) only (for the moment?)
